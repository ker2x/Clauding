I'm on a macbook air M3. there is a bunch of project in this directory that you (and claude) created. Lots of fun stuff.  Using native mac library/language turned out to be a great success. 

Now, i would like to create a virtual wind tunnel. With real CFD. Using ObjC or Swift, and metal in necessary. As well as all the available mac library that might be necessary. 

To limit the amout of parameters. Let's just assum it's always air. Let's not go too deep in reynold number and complex "pro" cfd. We might even go with a fixed grid if a grid generation on the fly is too difficult.

Pure 2D. 3D is too much for my mac.

Wind come from left, to right.
up & down boundary are slip boundary. it will save some headache (or not?)

i want to be able to draw a shape with the mouse, then start the virtual wind tunnel.
I want to be able to adjust wind speed.

Create a new CFD directory. create a plan in a md file in this directory.
We're in planning phase only.
Feel free to ask question
